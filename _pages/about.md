I’m a 90’s kid, an engineer by passion and an experimenter within. Concepts of Mathematics intrigued me while growing up, and at the adult stage, my theoretical knowledge led the practical applications at many points in my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering.

As a data science student, I started with learning foundations of data science and gradually built necessary skills required for excelling the subject and doing many projects in the field of machine learning, deep learning, statistical data analysis, data visualization,  natural language processing and a few others

I'm proficient in **Machine Learning using Python & R**
